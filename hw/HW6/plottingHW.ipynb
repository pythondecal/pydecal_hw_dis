    "This problem in an exercise in plotting random data. First you must generate three lists of random numbers, each 40 elements long with values ranging from 0 to 100. Then make two stacked vertical subplots. The top plot should plot one list of random data in orange and with a line width of 10 and another list in red and dashed. The bottom plot should be a scatter plot of the final list with magenta diamonds as the marker. In each case the x coordinate should be the position in the list.\n",

    "\n",
    "In stars, there are two main methods of energy transport: radiative diffusion (where photons move energy through gas) and convection (where hot gas and colder gas exchange places). These procecess have associated temperature gradients, describing how the temperature changes as position (radius) inside the star changes. The star can only have one true temperature gradient which sometimes aligns with the radiative (radiative diffusion) or adiabatic (convection) temperature gradient. Convection only occurs when the true temperature gradient is aligned with the adiabatic temeprature gradient.\n",

    "In the files `structure1_00001.txt`, `structure5_00001.txt`, `structure4_00001.txt`, there is data on the radius and temperature gradients for stars of three different masses: $0.5 M_\\odot$, $1 M_\\odot$ and $4 M_\\odot$ respectively. Make a figure with three subplots, half for each star. On each subplots, plot the three temperature gradients, each in a different color and line style, and change the y axis to be logarithmic scale. On these plots indicate the convection zone(s) where the true temperature gradient is much closer to the adiabatic temeprature gradient than the radiative temeprature gradient.\n",

    "The files contain a lot of data, but only some of it is useful to us. Namely the second (2) column contains the radius points of the measurement, the ninth (9) column contains the adiabatic temeprature gradient, the fourteenth (14) column contains the radiative temperature gradient and the fifteenth (15) columns contains the true temperature gradient.\n",
